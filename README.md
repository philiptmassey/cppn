# cppn

This module is used to generate images via untrained neural networks. This code
is largely stolen from [Generating Abstract Patterns with TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patterns-with-tensorflow/).
I would recommend reading this post for a background in the CPPN algorithm and
recommendations for modifying the network to generate different kinds of images.
